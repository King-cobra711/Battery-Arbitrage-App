============================================

PRICE DATA GENERATION (WITH SOLAR CRASH MODELING)
================================================

Base Price Calculation:
- Base Price = $80/MWh (QLD wholesale average)

Seasonal Adjustments:
- Summer (Dec-Feb): Base Price × 1.2
- Winter (Jun-Aug): Base Price × 1.15
- Autumn (Mar-May): Base Price × 0.9
- Spring (Sep-Nov): Base Price × 0.85

SOLAR GENERATION PATTERNS:
- Early Morning Ramp (6-10 AM): Solar intensity = (hour - 6) / 4
- Ramp Up (10-11:30 AM): Solar intensity = 0.8 + (hour - 10) × 0.13
- Peak Solar (11:30 AM-1:00 PM): Solar intensity = 1.0
- Ramp Down (1:00-2:30 PM): Solar intensity = 1.0 - (hour - 13) × 0.13
- Afternoon Decline (2:30-6 PM): Solar intensity = max(0, 0.8 - (hour - 14.5) × 0.2)

Seasonal Solar Intensity:
- Summer (Dec-Feb): Solar intensity × 1.3 (strongest)
- Winter (Jun-Aug): Solar intensity × 0.6 (weakest)
- Autumn (Mar-May): Solar intensity × 0.8
- Spring (Sep-Nov): Solar intensity × 1.1

SOLAR CRASH PRICE EFFECTS:
- 10-11:30 AM: Solar crash = Solar intensity × 0.3 (up to 30% price reduction)
- 11:30 AM-1:00 PM: Solar crash = Solar intensity × 0.8 (up to 80% price reduction, can go negative)
- 1:00-2:30 PM: Solar crash = Solar intensity × 0.5 (up to 50% price reduction)
- Morning Ramp (7-9 AM): Solar factor = 1.1 (higher prices before solar)
- Evening Ramp (17-19): Solar factor = 1.8 (highest prices after solar drops)

Time-of-Day Factors (Modified for Solar):
- Morning Peak (6-9 AM): Base Price × 1.6 (before solar)
- Solar Peak (10-16): Base Price × 0.8 (reduced due to solar)
- Evening Peak (17-20): Base Price × 2.2 (highest due to solar drop + demand)
- Off-Peak Night (22-6): Base Price × 0.6
- Other Daytime: Base Price × 1.0

Weekend Adjustment:
- Weekend Prices = Weekday Prices × 0.8
- Weekend Solar Crash = Solar intensity × 0.3 (reduced solar crash)

Final Price Formula (with Solar):
- Final Price = Base Price × Seasonal Factor × Time Factor × Solar Factor × (1 + Volatility)
- Where: Volatility = ±15% random variation
- Price Bounds: 
  * Normal times: $20 - $300/MWh
  * Peak solar (11:30 AM-1:00 PM): -$50 to $300/MWh

SOLAR CRASH TIME PATTERNS:
- 10:00 AM: Rooftop & utility solar ramping up, prices begin to fall
- 11:30 AM: Solar near maximum output, prices often <$50/MWh
- 12:00-1:00 PM: Maximum solar penetration, prices can be $0 or negative
- 2:00-2:30 PM: Solar starts ramping down, prices begin rising again

BATTERY SPECIFICATIONS
======================

Power to Energy Conversion (30-min intervals):
- Max Discharge per 30min = Battery Power (MW) × 0.5 hours
- Max Charge per 30min = Battery Power (MW) × 0.5 hours

Efficiency Conversion:
- Efficiency Decimal = Round-trip Efficiency (%) ÷ 100
- Example: 85% efficiency = 0.85

CHARGE CALCULATIONS
===================

Charge Amount (per 30-min interval):
- Charge Amount = min(Battery Power × 0.5, Available Capacity)
- Where: Available Capacity = Battery Capacity - Current Energy Stored

Charge Cost:
- Charge Cost = Charge Amount (MWh) × Electricity Price ($/MWh)
- Note: Can be negative during peak solar (paid to consume)

Energy Stored After Charge:
- New Energy Stored = Current Energy Stored + Charge Amount

DISCHARGE CALCULATIONS
======================

Discharge Amount (per 30-min interval):
- Discharge Amount = min(Battery Power × 0.5, Energy Stored × Efficiency)

Discharge Revenue:
- Discharge Revenue = Discharge Amount (MWh) × Electricity Price ($/MWh)

Energy Removed from Battery:
- Energy Removed = Discharge Amount ÷ Efficiency

Energy Stored After Discharge:
- New Energy Stored = Current Energy Stored - Energy Removed

PROFIT CALCULATIONS
===================

Daily Profit:
- Daily Profit = Total Discharge Revenue - Total Charge Cost
- Note: Charge cost can be negative during solar crash periods

Cumulative Profit:
- Cumulative Profit = Previous Cumulative Profit + Daily Profit

Profit Margin:
- Profit Margin (%) = (Daily Profit ÷ Total Charge Cost) × 100

SOLAR ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES
=============================

Optimal Charge Strategy:
- Target midday solar crash periods (10 AM-4 PM)
- Focus on 11:30 AM-1:00 PM for negative prices
- Consider overnight/off-peak periods
- Account for seasonal solar intensity variations

Optimal Discharge Strategy:
- Target evening peak periods (5-8 PM) when solar drops
- Consider morning ramp periods (6-9 AM) before solar peaks
- Maximize energy sales revenue during high-demand periods

Solar Crash Arbitrage:
- Charge during solar peak: Buy low during midday solar generation
- Discharge during evening peak: Sell high when solar drops and demand peaks
- Negative price opportunities: Charge when prices are negative (paid to consume)
- Seasonal adjustments: Stronger solar effects in summer

KEY METRICS
===========

Total Profit:
- Total Profit = Sum of all daily profits

Average Daily Profit:
- Average Daily Profit = Total Profit ÷ Number of Days

Return on Investment (ROI):
- ROI (%) = (Total Profit ÷ Battery Cost) × 100

Payback Period:
- Payback Period (years) = Battery Cost ÷ (Average Daily Profit × 365)

Solar Crash Impact:
- Price Reduction = ((Non-Solar Avg - Solar Avg) ÷ Non-Solar Avg) × 100
- Solar Hours: 10 AM-4 PM
- Non-Solar Hours: All other hours

EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS (WITH SOLAR CRASH)
=======================================

Scenario: 100 MW / 400 MWh Battery, 85% Efficiency

Charge Period (11:30 AM-1:00 PM, -$10/MWh during solar crash):
- Charge Amount = min(100 × 0.5, 400 - 0) = 50 MWh
- Charge Cost = 50 MWh × -$10/MWh = -$500 (paid to consume)
- Energy Stored = 0 + 50 = 50 MWh

Discharge Period (5 PM-7 PM, $180/MWh after solar drops):
- Discharge Amount = min(100 × 0.5, 50 × 0.85) = min(50, 42.5) = 42.5 MWh
- Discharge Revenue = 42.5 MWh × $180/MWh = $7,650
- Energy Removed = 42.5 ÷ 0.85 = 50 MWh
- Energy Stored = 50 - 50 = 0 MWh

Daily Profit:
- Daily Profit = $7,650 - (-$500) = $8,150

TRADING WINDOW OPTIMIZATION (SOLAR ERA)
=======================================

Optimal Charge Window:
