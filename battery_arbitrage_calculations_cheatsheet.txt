BATTERY ARBITRAGE CALCULATIONS CHEAT SHEET
============================================

PRICE DATA GENERATION
=====================

Base Price Calculation:
- Base Price = $80/MWh (QLD wholesale average)

Seasonal Adjustments:
- Summer (Dec-Feb): Base Price × 1.2
- Winter (Jun-Aug): Base Price × 1.15
- Autumn (Mar-May): Base Price × 0.9
- Spring (Sep-Nov): Base Price × 0.85

Time-of-Day Factors:
- Morning Peak (6-9 AM): Base Price × 1.8
- Evening Peak (5-8 PM): Base Price × 2.0
- Off-Peak Night (10 PM-6 AM): Base Price × 0.6
- Daytime (Other): Base Price × 1.2

Weekend Adjustment:
- Weekend Prices = Weekday Prices × 0.8

Final Price Formula:
- Final Price = Base Price × Seasonal Factor × Time Factor × (1 + Volatility)
- Where: Volatility = ±15% random variation
- Price Bounds: $20 - $300/MWh

BATTERY SPECIFICATIONS
======================

Power to Energy Conversion (30-min intervals):
- Max Discharge per 30min = Battery Power (MW) × 0.5 hours
- Max Charge per 30min = Battery Power (MW) × 0.5 hours

Efficiency Conversion:
- Efficiency Decimal = Round-trip Efficiency (%) ÷ 100
- Example: 85% efficiency = 0.85

CHARGE CALCULATIONS
===================

Charge Amount (per 30-min interval):
- Charge Amount = min(Battery Power × 0.5, Available Capacity)
- Where: Available Capacity = Battery Capacity - Current Energy Stored

Charge Cost:
- Charge Cost = Charge Amount (MWh) × Electricity Price ($/MWh)

Energy Stored After Charge:
- New Energy Stored = Current Energy Stored + Charge Amount

DISCHARGE CALCULATIONS
======================

Discharge Amount (per 30-min interval):
- Discharge Amount = min(Battery Power × 0.5, Energy Stored × Efficiency)

Discharge Revenue:
- Discharge Revenue = Discharge Amount (MWh) × Electricity Price ($/MWh)

Energy Removed from Battery:
- Energy Removed = Discharge Amount ÷ Efficiency

Energy Stored After Discharge:
- New Energy Stored = Current Energy Stored - Energy Removed

PROFIT CALCULATIONS
===================

Daily Profit:
- Daily Profit = Total Discharge Revenue - Total Charge Cost

Cumulative Profit:
- Cumulative Profit = Previous Cumulative Profit + Daily Profit

Profit Margin:
- Profit Margin (%) = (Daily Profit ÷ Total Charge Cost) × 100

KEY METRICS
===========

Total Profit:
- Total Profit = Sum of all daily profits

Average Daily Profit:
- Average Daily Profit = Total Profit ÷ Number of Days

Return on Investment (ROI):
- ROI (%) = (Total Profit ÷ Battery Cost) × 100

Payback Period:
- Payback Period (years) = Battery Cost ÷ (Average Daily Profit × 365)

EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS
===================

Scenario: 100 MW / 400 MWh Battery, 85% Efficiency

Charge Period (10 AM - 2 PM, $60/MWh):
- Charge Amount = min(100 × 0.5, 400 - 0) = 50 MWh
- Charge Cost = 50 MWh × $60/MWh = $3,000
- Energy Stored = 0 + 50 = 50 MWh

Discharge Period (5 PM - 9 PM, $150/MWh):
- Discharge Amount = min(100 × 0.5, 50 × 0.85) = min(50, 42.5) = 42.5 MWh
- Discharge Revenue = 42.5 MWh × $150/MWh = $6,375
- Energy Removed = 42.5 ÷ 0.85 = 50 MWh
- Energy Stored = 50 - 50 = 0 MWh

Daily Profit:
- Daily Profit = $6,375 - $3,000 = $3,375

TRADING WINDOW OPTIMIZATION
===========================

Optimal Charge Window:
- Lowest average prices during the day
- Sufficient duration to fill battery capacity
- Before peak demand periods

Optimal Discharge Window:
- Highest average prices during the day
- Peak demand periods
- After charge window completion

Profit Maximization Formula:
- Max Profit = max(Discharge Price - Charge Price) × Energy × Efficiency

DATA PROCESSING
===============

30-Minute Intervals:
- Intervals per Day = 24 hours × 2 = 48 intervals
- Intervals per Hour = 2 intervals

Price Data Structure:
- Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- Price: $/MWh (2 decimal places)

Date Range:
- Start Date = Current Date - Days Back
- End Date = Current Date

CONSTRAINTS & LIMITATIONS
=========================

Power Constraints:
- Max Discharge Rate = Battery Power (MW)
- Max Charge Rate = Battery Power (MW)

Energy Constraints:
- Max Energy Stored = Battery Capacity (MWh)
- Min Energy Stored = 0 MWh

Efficiency Constraints:
- Available Energy = Stored Energy × Efficiency
- Energy Loss = Energy × (1 - Efficiency)

EXPORT DATA FORMAT
==================

Daily Results CSV:
- Date, Charge Cost ($), Discharge Revenue ($), Daily Profit ($), Energy Stored (MWh), Cumulative Profit ($)

Configuration Summary:
- Parameter, Value
- Battery Power (MW), [value]
- Battery Capacity (MWh), [value]
- Round-trip Efficiency (%), [value]
- Charge Window, [start]:00 - [end]:00
- Discharge Window, [start]:00 - [end]:00
- Simulation Period, [days] days

KEY INSIGHTS
============

Profit Drivers:
1. Price Spread: Higher difference between charge and discharge prices
2. Battery Size: Larger capacity = more energy arbitrage
3. Efficiency: Higher efficiency = less energy loss
4. Trading Windows: Optimal timing maximizes profit

Risk Factors:
1. Price Volatility: Unpredictable price movements
2. Battery Degradation: Reduced capacity over time
3. Market Changes: Regulatory or structural changes
4. Technical Issues: Battery or grid failures
