BATTERY ARBITRAGE PROFIT CALCULATION EXPLANATION
================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This app calculates profit from battery arbitrage by buying electricity during low-price periods and selling during high-price periods, accounting for battery efficiency losses and operational constraints. The app now includes solar crash modeling to reflect modern electricity markets with high solar penetration.

CORE PROFIT FORMULA
-------------------
Daily Profit = Total Discharge Revenue - Total Charge Cost

Where:
- Total Discharge Revenue = Sum of (Discharge Amount × Discharge Price) for all discharge periods
- Total Charge Cost = Sum of (Charge Amount × Charge Price) for all charge periods
- Note: Charge cost can be negative during solar crash periods (paid to consume)

DETAILED CALCULATION PROCESS
----------------------------

1. PRICE DATA GENERATION (WITH SOLAR CRASH MODELING)
---------------------------------------------------
The app generates realistic QLD electricity prices using:

Base Price: $80/MWh

Seasonal Adjustments:
- Summer (Dec-Feb): × 1.2
- Winter (Jun-Aug): × 1.15  
- Autumn (Mar-May): × 0.9
- Spring (Sep-Nov): × 0.85

SOLAR GENERATION PATTERNS:
- Early Morning Ramp (6-10 AM): Solar intensity = (hour - 6) / 4
- Ramp Up (10-11:30 AM): Solar intensity = 0.8 + (hour - 10) × 0.13
- Peak Solar (11:30 AM-1:00 PM): Solar intensity = 1.0
- Ramp Down (1:00-2:30 PM): Solar intensity = 1.0 - (hour - 13) × 0.13
- Afternoon Decline (2:30-6 PM): Solar intensity = max(0, 0.8 - (hour - 14.5) × 0.2)

Seasonal Solar Intensity:
- Summer (Dec-Feb): Solar intensity × 1.3 (strongest)
- Winter (Jun-Aug): Solar intensity × 0.6 (weakest)
- Autumn (Mar-May): Solar intensity × 0.8
- Spring (Sep-Nov): Solar intensity × 1.1

SOLAR CRASH PRICE EFFECTS:
- 10-11:30 AM: Solar crash = Solar intensity × 0.3 (up to 30% price reduction)
- 11:30 AM-1:00 PM: Solar crash = Solar intensity × 0.8 (up to 80% price reduction, can go negative)
- 1:00-2:30 PM: Solar crash = Solar intensity × 0.5 (up to 50% price reduction)
- Morning Ramp (7-9 AM): Solar factor = 1.1 (higher prices before solar)
- Evening Ramp (17-19): Solar factor = 1.8 (highest prices after solar drops)

Time-of-Day Factors (Modified for Solar):
- Morning Peak (6-9 AM): Base Price × 1.6 (before solar)
- Solar Peak (10-16): Base Price × 0.8 (reduced due to solar)
- Evening Peak (17-20): Base Price × 2.2 (highest due to solar drop + demand)
- Off-Peak Night (22-6): Base Price × 0.6
- Other Daytime: Base Price × 1.0

SOLAR CRASH TIME PATTERNS:
- 10:00 AM: Rooftop & utility solar ramping up, prices begin to fall
- 11:30 AM: Solar near maximum output, prices often <$50/MWh
- 12:00-1:00 PM: Maximum solar penetration, prices can be $0 or negative
- 2:00-2:30 PM: Solar starts ramping down, prices begin rising again

Final Price Formula (with Solar):
Final Price = Base Price × Seasonal Factor × Time Factor × Solar Factor × (1 + Volatility)
Where Volatility = ±15% random variation
Price Bounds: 
- Normal times: $20 - $300/MWh
- Peak solar (11:30 AM-1:00 PM): -$50 to $300/MWh

2. BATTERY OPERATION CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------

Power Constraints (per 30-minute interval):
- Max Discharge Rate = Battery Power (MW)
- Max Charge Rate = Battery Power (MW)
- Actual Discharge = min(Battery Power × 0.5, Available Energy × Efficiency)
- Actual Charge = min(Battery Power × 0.5, Available Capacity)

Energy Constraints:
- Max Energy Stored = Battery Capacity (MWh)
- Min Energy Stored = 0 MWh
- Available Capacity = Battery Capacity - Current Energy Stored

Efficiency Constraints:
- Round-trip Efficiency = User Input (e.g., 85%)
- Efficiency Decimal = Efficiency % ÷ 100 (e.g., 0.85)
- Available Energy for Discharge = Stored Energy × Efficiency
- Energy Loss = Energy × (1 - Efficiency)

Solar Constraints:
- Solar generation only during daylight hours (6 AM-6 PM)
- Seasonal solar intensity variations
- Geographic solar penetration factors

3. CHARGE CALCULATIONS
----------------------

For each 30-minute interval during charge periods:

Charge Amount = min(Battery Power × 0.5, Available Capacity)
Where: Available Capacity = Battery Capacity - Current Energy Stored

Charge Cost = Charge Amount (MWh) × Electricity Price ($/MWh)
Note: Can be negative during peak solar (paid to consume)

New Energy Stored = Current Energy Stored + Charge Amount

Example (Solar Crash Period):
- Battery Power: 100 MW
- Available Capacity: 400 MWh
- Price: -$10/MWh (during solar crash)
- Charge Amount = min(100 × 0.5, 400) = min(50, 400) = 50 MWh
- Charge Cost = 50 MWh × -$10/MWh = -$500 (paid to consume)
- Energy Stored = 0 + 50 = 50 MWh

4. DISCHARGE CALCULATIONS
-------------------------

For each 30-minute interval during discharge periods:

Discharge Amount = min(Battery Power × 0.5, Energy Stored × Efficiency)

Discharge Revenue = Discharge Amount (MWh) × Electricity Price ($/MWh)

Energy Removed from Battery = Discharge Amount ÷ Efficiency

Example (Evening Peak After Solar Drop):
- Battery Power: 100 MW
- Energy Stored: 50 MWh
- Efficiency: 85% (0.85)
- Price: $180/MWh (evening peak after solar drops)
- Discharge Amount = min(100 × 0.5, 50 × 0.85) = min(50, 42.5) = 42.5 MWh
- Discharge Revenue = 42.5 MWh × $180/MWh = $7,650
- Energy Removed = 42.5 ÷ 0.85 = 50 MWh
- Energy Stored = 50 - 50 = 0 MWh

5. DAILY PROFIT CALCULATION
---------------------------

The app processes each day separately:

1. Identifies charge periods (user-defined hours)
2. Identifies discharge periods (user-defined hours)
3. Calculates total charge cost for the day (can be negative during solar crash)
4. Calculates total discharge revenue for the day
5. Calculates daily profit = discharge revenue - charge cost

Example Daily Calculation (with Solar Crash):
- Total Charge Cost: -$500 (paid to consume during solar crash)
- Total Discharge Revenue: $7,650
- Daily Profit: $7,650 - (-$500) = $8,150

6. CUMULATIVE PROFIT
--------------------

Cumulative Profit = Previous Cumulative Profit + Daily Profit

Example:
- Day 1 Profit: $8,150
- Day 2 Profit: $6,200
- Cumulative Profit Day 1: $8,150
- Cumulative Profit Day 2: $8,150 + $6,200 = $14,350

7. SOLAR ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES
--------------------------------

Optimal Charge Strategy:
- Target midday solar crash periods (10 AM-4 PM)
- Focus on 11:30 AM-1:00 PM for negative prices
- Consider overnight/off-peak periods
- Account for seasonal solar intensity variations

Optimal Discharge Strategy:
- Target evening peak periods (5-8 PM) when solar drops
- Consider morning ramp periods (6-9 AM) before solar peaks
- Maximize energy sales revenue during high-demand periods

Solar Crash Arbitrage:
- Charge during solar peak: Buy low during midday solar generation
- Discharge during evening peak: Sell high when solar drops and demand peaks
- Negative price opportunities: Charge when prices are negative (paid to consume)
- Seasonal adjustments: Stronger solar effects in summer

Factors that can reduce profit:
1. Price volatility and unpredictability
2. Solar generation variability (weather-dependent)
3. Battery degradation over time
4. Market structure changes
5. Technical failures
6. Regulatory changes
7. Solar penetration changes (increasing adoption)

11. EXAMPLE COMPLETE CALCULATION (WITH SOLAR CRASH)
---------------------------------------------------

Scenario: 100 MW / 400 MWh Battery, 85% Efficiency

Day 1:
- Charge Period (11:30 AM-1:00 PM): 1.5 hours, -$10/MWh average (solar crash)
- Discharge Period (5 PM-7 PM): 2 hours, $180/MWh average (evening peak)

Charge Calculations:
- Charge Amount per 30min = min(100 × 0.5, 400) = 50 MWh
- Total Charge Amount = 50 MWh × 3 intervals = 150 MWh
- Total Charge Cost = 150 MWh × -$10/MWh = -$1,500 (paid to consume)
- Energy Stored = 150 MWh

Discharge Calculations:
- Available Energy = 150 MWh × 0.85 = 127.5 MWh
- Discharge Amount per 30min = min(100 × 0.5, 127.5) = 50 MWh
- Total Discharge Amount = 50 MWh × 4 intervals = 200 MWh
- Total Discharge Revenue = 200 MWh × $180/MWh = $36,000
- Energy Removed = 200 MWh ÷ 0.85 = 235.3 MWh
- Final Energy Stored = 150 - 235.3 = -85.3 MWh (capped at 0)

Daily Profit = $36,000 - (-$1,500) = $37,500

This example shows how solar crash effects with negative prices can significantly increase battery arbitrage profitability compared to traditional price spreads.
